I read a book which explains less known concepts about Python3.
You can find the book at this location: https://diveintopython3.net/index.html

I have created folders corresponding to each chapter. 
The notebooks contain some important points about concepts and the code related to it.

Chapters are as follows:
1.  Your First Python Program
2.  Native Datatypes
3.  Comprehensions
4.  Strings
5.  Regular Expressions
6.  Closures & Generators
7.  Classes & Iterators
8.  Advanced Iterators
9.  Unit Testing
10. Refactoring
11. Files
12. XML
13. Serializing Python Objects
14. HTTP Web Services
15. Case Study: Porting chardet to Python 3
16. Packaging Python Libraries
