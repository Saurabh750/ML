I have implemented TSNE Algorithm from scratch in this folder.

TSNE is a non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithm. 
It is a powerful algorithm for visualization when you are working with non-linear data.

I referred the following articles/papers for in depth understanding of the algorithm:
1) https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume9/vandermaaten08a/vandermaaten08a.pdf
2) https://towardsdatascience.com/t-sne-clearly-explained-d84c537f53a
